# Weather-Details
Project Details

This weather application I developed using the APIs offered by OpenWeatherMap.
When we first open the application, a Screen will apprear with search button on top.
We can search the city for which we want to get the details.
We can save the city in favrouite lists.

Basic Funtionalities Covered

1) Allow users to search for a given city.
2) Allow users to create/manage list of favrouite destinations.
3) Detailed Weather Data.
4) In case of network un-availablity, user will be shown the old saved city data. Incase that city is not in favrouite then previous city search data will come.
5) This application is for all screen sizes and orientaions
